                  Week 1

                  - My first week was about three times more difficult than I expected. I'd consider the stresses of
                  getting the workplaces setup more difficult than our final project from intro to web development.
                  Debugging is something I've had experience with and had success with but git is something that has
                  confused me for years and I was never able to surmount that mountain to understand how to use it
                  properly.
                  - I am excited to learn backend development since that will be brand new to me and I think it's a
                  career path I would like to pursue. The visual creativity of frontend development is something I find
                  especially exhausting. I want to see what the backend entails.
                  - Hm....it's hard to think of something to share about myself that can only be learned by reading this
                  blog since a lot of my life is shared online. I just snapped my fingers 15 times on this date 8/25/23.
                  No one knows that except for me and you now, dear reader! :laughing:

                  Here is an actual variable I used in my Intro to Web Dev class this summer:
                  ```
                  const maskingString = "I believe in the mind
                  reader!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";
                  ```

                  I chose Dunetocat this week because it looks intrepid and I feel ready to kick butt this week.
                  I wish I could use Drupal since it seems like the trendy CMS to use at the moment. (Content management
                  system - I learned that this week!) but I don't know PHP yet.
                  I struggle with an initial overload moment each time I sit down to work. It's short but it's
                  disorienting. I think it will only minimize with time or I'll develop a higher confidence that it
                  won't stop me.
                  I solve problems by taking a mental intake of whether something in my mind is creating an obstacle
                  first. Am I frazzled? Am I fed? Am I exhausted? If I'm taken care of then I consult my resources on my
                  own. If I still can not find a solution within an hour then I reach out to my peers for help. If we
                  can't find the solution I was hoping for then I find an alternative that will help the most it can
                  then I move on!
                  The methods are use for getting unstuck: get fresh air, eat something, workout, lay down, consult
                  documentation, Google, ask Bob Dos, ask my peers, find a new method!

                  I chose NUXtocat for this week because its image appears laid back and excited to create. It's also
                  holding the hand waving signal which I'm attributing to a willingness to seek help and share
                  accomplishments and challenges.

                  I like an analogy that Jacob made over the summer regarding the roles of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                  HTML is like the skeleton. It's the bare bones - the structure. CSS is like the skin. It's what we
                  cover the HTML in to pretty it up. Javascript is the muscles and joints that allow the skeleton to
                  function - to move around and do a lil happy dance.

                  My blog is made from markdown at the moment. I incorporate gifs and pngs for pictures. It's formatted
                  with unordered lists and line breaks. As the blog develops I can use html to create a nav bar and CSS
                  to apply some pastel colors. I can use javascript to create a carousel or a stickied nav bar.

                  We are in Sprint 1! Goodbye, onboarding - hello, world! I chose yogitocat today because I feel calm
                  and in the moment. I'm ready to accept the things I learn and embrace the struggle of the unknown.

                  I'm being held back by a desire to want to keep my old schedule with going to the gym and having time
                  to play videogames in my downtime. I have to embrace that this bootcamp is a short commitment to put
                  learning at the top of my scheduling hierarchy but it's not forever. The gym and my steam library will
                  be waiting for me in a couple short months.

                  I would like to learn more about JSON and not be as intimidated by it. I can do this by reviewing old
                  freeCodeCamp lessons and reading documentation.

                  What is my "why" for this bootcamp? I want independence and a new skillset to be artistic and
                  innovative. I want to build long term ties with my battle buddy teachers and classmates.

                  - I've made it to Sprint 2 - VanillaJS. I chose boxertocat because I feel empowered to kick
                  javascript's butt. I think I have a
                  leg up because javascript is not the first logical programming language I've learned so I know there
                  is getting past the cliff of despair when it comes to adding to your language repertoire.
                  I also feel empowered because we studied a lot of javascript lessons over the summer during pre-work.

                  - One thing that I've learned is that the development process is a lot like making a
                  sandwich (oh great now I'm craving a tofurkey sandwich on sourdough as I type this at 1:30am...mmmmmmm
                  sourdough).
                  You need to gather all your ingredients (requirements), prepare your workspace (set up your
                  development environment),
                  and then start building your sandwich (writing code). But the key is to take it one step at a time,
                  just like you'd add ingredients
                  one by one. And, just like with a sandwich, if you mess up a step, you might end up with a messy code
                  sandwich!

                  - Developing good code is like creating a recipe that's easy for others to follow (or your future self
                  who will likely forget what you were doing).
                  You want to make sure your code doesn't waste resources or take forever to execute because then the
                  user will get hangry.

                  - Being a good developer goes beyond writing code. You have to communicate well, work collaboratively,
                  and be open to
                  learning and improving your skills. You have to be patient when bugs appear and be able to balance
                  creativity with structure similar to a comedian who ties
                  spontaniety with well-rehearsed routine.

                  - You know what programmers hate doing? Naming things because naming is hard.

                  In the world of software development, pseudocode is a hot topic. Some swear by it, while others cringe
                  at its mention. However, understanding its role and adopting a pragmatic approach can be a
                  game-changer.

                  Pseudocode is like the blueprint for building software. It's the logic and structure you plan before
                  diving into actual coding. Think of it as the architectural sketch before constructing a building.
                  It's the essential first step towards creating robust and maintainable code.

                  The Journey of Pseudocode
                  Pseudocode isn't one-size-fits-all; it adapts to your style. Imagine an application process where you
                  had to pseudocode making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. What seemed simple was surprisingly
                  intricate. It highlights the depth of detail pseudocode can uncover.

                  The Unfinished Guide
                  Pseudocode is not a finished product; it's an ever-evolving tool. Instead of striving for perfection,
                  consider it a flexible guide. It's like sculpting – you start with a rough block and refine it as you
                  go, revealing the art within.

                  Deconstructing Complexity
                  When you face a puzzling part of your pseudocode, it's time to deconstruct it. Step back, inspect
                  individual pieces, and refine them if necessary. This process untangles complex problems and eases
                  communication with peers.

                  Embracing Human-Centric Design
                  In coding, the goal is to enhance the human experience, not just write code. Pseudocode bridges ideas
                  and code, serving as your daily exercise to plan like an architect before building. It's simple, like
                  sketching with a pencil, and it's your ally in creating software that improves lives.
                  <!-- > Pseudocode is an abstract concept that when you are thinking about a 
                problem u wanna put it in logic and then that logic can lead to thinking in 
                the framework or software youre gonna build in.  I think it's a requirement 
                for life.

                > I hate pseudocode
                
                -- William Carson Burroughs, Awesome Inc Bootcamp Student, circa Fall 2023
                
                I chose tentocats this week because the building blocks remind me of the pains,
                um I mean, the challenges of writing pseudocode.  The 10 is also meaningful 
                because there are 10 more weeks left of bootcamp.
                
                Pseudocode is a hotly debated topic amongst our cohort community.  
                Is it worth it to do?  I am obligated to say yes because my teacher is reading 
                this.
                
                I've approached pseudocode in a variety of ways and there does not seem 
                to be a right or wrong way to approach it as long as it helps you in writing 
                code and helps you and others understand your code.
                
                When I applied for the bootcamp I had to submit pseudocode for making a 
                peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I found it so difficult. No matter how I 
                broke down the steps I felt like there was always smaller pieces to break down.  
                It felt agonizing to feel like there was no end to this list of instructions.  
                
                It's helped me to learn that pseudocode does not have to be a finished product 
                before you start coding.  It's there to help you and it's never finished so 
                completing it - smashing the building blocks into finer and finer dust is 
                counter-productive.  
                
                Break down your data structures.  Plan out what you need.  When you encounter 
                one piece of it and you find yourself staring at the computer not sure of where 
                to go that's when you can take your whittling tools and break it down.  Stop and 
                look at the pieces. Is there enough for you to move forward?
                
                I'm still on a journey of learning to love pseudocode but I will concede it is 
                helpful.  My morning exercises have helped me practise writing pseudocode as if 
                I were solving the issue, or creating the user story, with pencil and paper.  
                No code at all.  You can always translate your process to code.  But you must 
                first navigate what you're doing in a human perspective.  After all -- we code 
                to improve the human experience not to write the perfect sequence of symbols on 
                a screen (I'm looking at you, code golfers!) -->

                  I chose godotocat because React is a jump into the void!
                  I think this is the first entirely new library I am learning
                  in this bootcamp.  Although we have been properly warned
                  that it could be a scary experience I see it as new and bright
                  in its new syntax and ways of creating solutions.

                  That being said - I definitely still find it difficult
                  to use as it requires leaving my very small comfort zone
                  in the programming world.  I'm interested to learn about
                  Tailwind and daisyUI going forward.  I've heard good things
                  from bootcamp alumni.  I would love to learn more about 
                  and use TypeScript in my final project.

                  I chose privateinvestocat this week because it's black 
                  and white and so is the command line for the most part.
                  It also looks cool and mysterious and that's how I feel now
                  that I use the command line primarily for my git commands.

                  I remember clutching to the git command guide during my
                  first week and struggling to make a new branch.  I was in 
                  constant fear that I couldn't communicate via the command line
                  and I would fall so far behind in my projects.  Every time I typed
                  something I braced myself to see errors that would stump me and 
                  my teachers.

                  Fast forward to today and I make branches and make commits and 
                  pushes in my sleep or very close to it during late night coding 
                  sessions. I no longer find the CLI scary and I feel like a cool
                  stereotypical hacker when I use it. 

                  Until being prompted now I never considered building a CLI unless
                  my old Python projects count.  If I were to build a CLI I would like
                  a simple 8 ball generator that gives you funny prompts and helps you 
                  be more decisive.  I love finding creative ways to cut decision
                  fatigue.  Life's too short for that.  And I'm already fatigued enough.
                  I imagine so many things would take a long time to code in the 
                  command line without a framework including a web server, a GUI,
                  a CMS, or a game engine with physics.
