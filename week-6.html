<h5><b>The Essence of Pseudocode in Software Development</b></h5>
<p>In the world of software development, pseudocode is a hot topic. 
    Some swear by it, while others cringe at its mention. However, 
    understanding its role and adopting a pragmatic approach can be a 
    game-changer.</p>

<h5><b>Pseudocode: Your Blueprint</b></h5>
<p>Pseudocode is like the blueprint for building software. It's the 
    logic and structure you plan before diving into actual coding. Think 
    of it as the architectural sketch before constructing a building. 
    It's the essential first step towards creating robust and maintainable
     code.</p>

<h5><b>The Journey of Pseudocode</b></h5>
<p>Pseudocode isn't one-size-fits-all; it adapts to your style. Imagine 
    an application process where you have to pseudocode making a peanut 
    butter and jelly sandwich. What seems simple is surprisingly 
    intricate. It highlights the depth of detail pseudocode can uncover.</p>

<h5><b>The Unfinished Guide</b></h5>
<p>Pseudocode is not a finished product; it's an ever-evolving tool. 
    Instead of striving for perfection, consider it a flexible guide. 
    It's like sculpting â€“ you start with a rough block and refine it as 
    you go, revealing the art within.</p>

<h5><b>Deconstructing Complexity</b></h5>
<p>When you face a puzzling part of your pseudocode, it's time to 
    deconstruct it. Step back, inspect individual pieces, and refine 
    them if necessary. This process untangles complex problems and eases 
    communication with peers.</p>

<h5><b>Embracing Human-Centric Design</b></h5>
<p>In coding, the goal is to enhance the human experience, not just 
    write code. Pseudocode bridges ideas and code, serving as your daily 
    exercise to plan like an architect before building. It's simple, like 
    sketching with a pencil, and it's your ally in creating software that 
    improves lives.</p>

        <p>I chose tentocats this week because the building blocks remind me of the pains,
            um I mean, the challenges of writing pseudocode. The 10 is also meaningful
            because there are 10 more weeks left of bootcamp.</p>

        <p>Pseudocode is a hotly debated topic amongst our cohort community.
            Is it worth it to do? I am obligated to say yes because my teacher is reading
            this.</p>

        <p>I've approached pseudocode in a variety of ways and there does not seem
            to be a right or wrong way to approach it as long as it helps you in writing
            code and helps you and others understand your code.</p>

        <p>When I applied for the bootcamp I had to submit pseudocode for making a
            peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I found it so difficult. No matter how I
            broke down the steps I felt like there was always smaller pieces to break down.
            It felt agonizing to feel like there was no end to this list of instructions. </p>

        <p> It's helped me to learn that pseudocode does not have to be a finished product
            before you start coding. It's there to help you and it's never finished so
            completing it - smashing the building blocks into finer and finer dust is
            counter-productive.</p>

        <p>Break down your data structures. Plan out what you need. When you encounter
            one piece of it and you find yourself staring at the computer not sure of where
            to go that's when you can take your whittling tools and break it down. Stop and
            look at the pieces. Is there enough for you to move forward?</p>

        <p> I'm still on a journey of learning to love pseudocode but I will concede it is
            helpful. My morning exercises have helped me practise writing pseudocode as if
            I were solving the issue, or creating the user story, with pencil and paper.
            No code at all. You can always translate your process to code. But you must
            first navigate what you're doing in a human perspective. After all -- we code
            to improve the human experience not to write the perfect sequence of symbols on
            a screen (I'm looking at you, code golfers!)
