# Vanessa's F23 Bootcamp Blog!!

## Week 1

- My first week was about three times more difficult than I expected.  I'd consider the stresses of getting the workplaces setup more difficult than our final project from intro to web development.  Debugging is something I've had experience with and had success with but git is something that has confused me for years and I was never able to surmount that mountain to understand how to use it properly.  
- I am excited to learn backend development since that will be brand new to me and I think it's a career path I would like to pursue.  The visual creativity of frontend development is something I find especially exhausting.  I want to see what the backend entails.
- Hm....it's hard to think of something to share about myself that can only be learned by reading this blog since a lot of my life is shared online.  I just snapped my fingers 15 times on this date 8/25/23.  No one knows that except for me and you now, dear reader! :laughing:

Here is an actual variable I used in my Intro to Web Dev class this summer:
```
const maskingString = "I believe in the mind reader!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";
```

## Week 2

- I chose Dunetocat this week because it looks intrepid and I feel ready to kick butt this week.
- I wish I could use Drupal since it seems like the trendy CMS to use at the moment.  (Content management system - I learned that this week!) but I don't know PHP yet.
- I struggle with an initial overload moment each time I sit down to work.  It's short but it's disorienting.  I think it will only minimize with time or I'll develop a higher confidence that it won't stop me.
- I solve problems by taking a mental intake of whether something in my mind is creating an obstacle first.  Am I frazzled?  Am I fed?  Am I exhausted?  If I'm taken care of then I consult my resources on my own.  If I still can not find a solution within an hour then I reach out to my peers for help.  If we can't find the solution I was hoping for then I find an alternative that will help the most it can then I move on!
 - The methods are use for getting unstuck: get fresh air, eat something, workout, lay down, consult documentation, Google, ask Bob Dos, ask my peers, find a new method!

### AHA Moments

#### Regarding pseudocode:

- Was definitely not capitalizing entire initial keywords before.  This makes it so much easier to glance at and take note of what is happening.
- Instead of thinking of pseudocode as extra work to be done in order to come off as organized think of it as less work.  You get to "write code" without any syntax killing your program.  This is obvious but throughout this bootcamp as a whole it helps me to find any method I can to "trick my brain".  Even though it's not "lazy" programming - telling my brain that it's a shortcut to be lazy makes my mind feel refreshed.
- Seeing how simple the pseudocode was for the PB&J sandwich.  I'm curious to know other's experiences because that pseudocode was my biggest challenge in the Figure It Out exercises for the bootcamp application.  I opened it up again out of curiosity and you can see how bogged down I became in the minor details.  Capitalizing initial keywords would have made it easier to read along with staying away from multi-lines.  It's a relief that pseudocode doesn't have to be as complicated as I made it out to be.

#### Regarding markdown image insertion:

Resolved an issue of my screenshots not appearing in my blog.

When I take a screenshot on my pc the image is auto-saved with a file name that has spaces in it.  If you have spaces in your image file paths in markdown the images will not appear.

Stack overflow gave me the solution: If you don't want to rename your files to exclude spaces type "%20" everywhere there is a space in the file path. Your alt text will highlight in green if successful.

Attached is the code before and after.

### Resources

If any of you are auditory learners like me - I just used a text-to-speech reader for the pseudocode Google slides and I found it helpful.  I told Team Boole that I believed it would be useful to have initial concepts read to me before my eyes see code examples.

With the Google Slides: You can select File > Download > Plain Text (.txt)
Open that file and copy and paste it into a TTS reader.

I like this one because it has free voices to choose from.
https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/

You can adjust the speed up to 5x! and when you hit play it shows the sentence that is being read highlighted at the bottom word by word.  It also shows you the total time it will take to read the entire document so if you have a time restraint you can allow it to speed read to fit your schedule.
My criticisms are that the free voices sound SUPER robotic and in the google slides it reads the headers so I heard a lot of repeated "pseudocode" "pseudocode" "pseudocode".

# Standups

**9/6/2023**

Mindspace Musing: 

- My brain feels like it's going to explode.  It's just one of those days where I'm extra exhausted even though I got plenty of sleep.  If you're familiar with those old ads that said "This is your brain on drugs" - I feel like "This is your brain on an AGILE Development sprint." I think I need to take more breaks to stand up and walk around.

Last 24: 

- Listened to pseudocode Google slides via a text to speech generator and posted my experience and a link to the site in the resources channel in slack

- Posted my AHA moments to the sprint 03 onboarding channel.  They include my thoughts on pseudocode and a fix to get your images to appear in your markdown blog.

- Copied these AHA moments into my blog so they won't disappear over the years when our bootcamp messages disappear. Jacob, my summer web dev instructor, told our class that after a few cohort sessions Slack reaches its max message capacity and the older messages get deleted so make sure you save what you want to hold onto.

- Watched the 2 pseudocode videos.

Larger goals:

- Move my posts over to my Bootstrap blog site and organize the cards to take you to my posts week by week.
- Also have a navigation bar that will sort hashtags of my AHA moments and resources and compile thse onto their own pages.
- I would also love to include a "mindspace musings" page because one of my overall goals as a developer is to provide avenues for mental health communication.  For me that goes hand-in-hand with how I approach development so I hope that could be a good resource for anyone who would read my blog.

Next 24:

- Write the pseudocode for the silly story generator in a pseudocode.md file broken down into functionality, objects, and data structures. I will copy that into my javascript file as comments and fill in my code around that.
- Find a way to add some spice. Maybe throw in an image API so whatever word you input in the generator will search that word through the website Unsplash and return a random image result so it's different with every click.

16th Minute Item:

- When I hit "go live" in Gitpod for my blog I would like it to show me a README.md preview.  Instead it shows a link and then when clicked it shows the markdown code.
