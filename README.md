### Week 1

- My first week was about three times more difficult than I expected.  I'd consider the stresses of getting the workplaces setup more difficult than our final project from intro to web development.  Debugging is something I've had experience with and had success with but git is something that has confused me for years and I was never able to surmount that mountain to understand how to use it properly.  
- I am excited to learn backend development since that will be brand new to me and I think it's a career path I would like to pursue.  The visual creativity of frontend development is something I find especially exhausting.  I want to see what the backend entails.
- Hm....it's hard to think of something to share about myself that can only be learned by reading this blog since a lot of my life is shared online.  I just snapped my fingers 15 times on this date 8/25/23.  No one knows that except for me and you now, dear reader! :laughing:

Here is an actual variable I used in my Intro to Web Dev class this summer:
```
const maskingString = "I believe in the mind reader!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!";
```

### Week 2

- I chose Dunetocat this week because it looks intrepid and I feel ready to kick butt this week.
- I wish I could use Drupal since it seems like the trendy CMS to use at the moment.  (Content management system - I learned that this week!) but I don't know PHP yet.
- I struggle with an initial overload moment each time I sit down to work.  It's short but it's disorienting.  I think it will only minimize with time or I'll develop a higher confidence that it won't stop me.
- I solve problems by taking a mental intake of whether something in my mind is creating an obstacle first.  Am I frazzled?  Am I fed?  Am I exhausted?  If I'm taken care of then I consult my resources on my own.  If I still can not find a solution within an hour then I reach out to my peers for help.  If we can't find the solution I was hoping for then I find an alternative that will help the most it can then I move on!
 - The methods are use for getting unstuck: get fresh air, eat something, workout, lay down, consult documentation, Google, ask Bob Dos, ask my peers, find a new method!
